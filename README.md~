SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is a protocol that provides data encryption and authenti-
cation between two parties, usually a client and a server, using Public Key Infrastruc-
ture (PKI). SSL was originally developed by Netscape and was later taken over by the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which renamed it TLS. HTTPS, or HTTP over
SSL, is essentially just that—HTTP layered over an SSL/TLS connection.
An SSL/TLS certificate (I’ll use the term SSL certificate as it’s more widely known) is
used to provide data encryption and authentication. An SSL certificate is an X.509-
formatted piece of data that contains some information, as well as a public key, stored
at a web server. SSL certificates are usually signed by a certificate authority (CA), which
assures the authenticity of the certificate. When the client makes a request to the
server, it returns with the certificate. If the client is satisfied that the certificate is
authentic, it will generate a random key and use the certificate (or more specifically
the public key in the certificate) to encrypt it. This symmetric key is the actual key
used to encrypt the data between the client and the server.git
